    <h1 class="service-page-title">Website Development</h1>
    <p>As the hub for your online marketing</a>&nbsp;and a sales tool, your website should have all the
        necessary functionality, with a design that effectively represents your brand. It must be easy for users
        to find and use, and well-structured for ongoing updates.&nbsp;At Harris Web Works, we specialize in
        building websites and handling all technical, content and marketing support to help businesses grow. We
        specialize in&nbsp;<a href="magento.php">Magento for ecommerce websites</a>, <a href="healthcare.php"
            rel="noopener">Drupal for healthcare websites</a>,&nbsp;and <a href="wordpress.php">WordPress for
            business websites</a>.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Our experienced team can provide all the support needed to help your website reach its full
            potential. When building a new site or updating an existing one, we’ll be your partner for
            programming, creative &amp; content development, search optimization, and marketing. We can also
            manage ongoing updates, or hand over the reigns and train you on handling updates.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h2>Create a Strong Online Presence and User Experience</h2>
    <p>These&nbsp;factors&nbsp;can make the difference between someone leaving your site or staying to become an
        advocate or loyal customer:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The look and feel</strong> –&nbsp;Your website must provide information visitors seek, in a
            clear and easy-to-navigate format. The design should represent your brand, vision and goals, with
            related search terms built in so search engines can recognize (index) the site and lead people to
            it.</li>
        <li><strong>Custom Coding and Design</strong>&nbsp;– While free website design templates may work fine
            for a basic website, they won’t facilitate projecting the distinctive, professional image you want
            to convey.&nbsp;<a href="http://mediumwell.com/premium-wordpress-themes/">Custom-coding provides
                several benefits</a>, and does not have to be cost prohibitive.</li>
        <li><strong>Content Strategy and Management</strong>&nbsp;– A user-friendly content management system
            such as WordPress makes it easy for administrators to add new pages, photos, text, etc. at any time,
            with no IT expertise needed. Continually adding content helps engage new and repeat visitors.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Combine Technical Features, Creativity and Common Sense</h2>
    <p>In addition to being&nbsp;useful for visitors/customers, your website&nbsp;can be a tool for
        various&nbsp;business functions. Whether you’re using the website to sell merchandise, offer services,
        gather leads, or share&nbsp;information,&nbsp;consider&nbsp;the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Network security</li>
        <li>Client-side and server-side scripting</li>
        <li>Database management</li>
        <li>Using the website to build a database of customers</li>
        <li>Sales funnels with distinct leads triggers</li>
        <li>Product customization</li>
        <li>Website portal for B2B or B2C presentations of data</li>
        <li>Customer forms, surveys and questionnaires</li>
    </ul>

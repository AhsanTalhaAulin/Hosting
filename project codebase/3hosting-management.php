	<h2>Hosting for eCommerce Sites</h2>
	<p>eCommerce businesses need the most reliable site speed, uptime, and disaster recovery protection, and they need their website framework to have the latest security patches. In addition to the above, our customized, high-performance hosting solutions for online stores include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Best-in-class hosting through <a href="amazon-cloud.php">Amazon Web Services&nbsp;(AWS),</a> managed by certified professionals</li>

	<h2>Hosting for Corporate and Service Business Sites</h2>
	<p>Enterprise level secure hosting is the preferred path for corporate clients who need top tier security and staging environments for their websites. Our experience includes setting up and managing hosting platforms for healthcare, life sciences, and biopharmaceutical sites, all of which require very precise handling of data and content. Options for corporate enterprise hosting include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Development, staging and production servers&nbsp;using<strong>&nbsp;</strong>SYNC Staging<sup>TM</sup><strong>,&nbsp;</strong>our proprietary&nbsp;website publishing tool</li>
		<li>HIPAA-compliant data collection, storage and retrieval, and&nbsp;HIPAA-compliant firewalls for <a href="website-dev.phphipaa-development-services/">healthcare websites</a></li>
	</ul>
	<p>Business-level managed hosting is ideal for local service companies where they don’t have the&nbsp; time, expertise or patience needed to handle hosting-related set up and maintenance. This provides convenience, peace-of-mind and just the right amount of hosting resources needed to keep the website running smoothly.</p>

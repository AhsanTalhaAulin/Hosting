	<p>If your online store is built in industry-leading Magento, it should have hosting that provides optimal performance. Enter cloud-based Amazon Web Services (AWS), the most reliable, flexible and fastest hosting platform available, known for providing excellent service to internet users around the world.</p>

		<p>When a Magento store is supported by Amazon’s hosting platform, the result is a website with the strongest framework possible – for a superior user experience and excellent growth potential.</p>
